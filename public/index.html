									Minecraft is a very popular game all over the world. Each server could contain many players. I tried to host a minecraft server using Google Cloud Platform. The most important thing is that the whole
									deployment process is running automatically. Since the server needs to change due to the growth of the users, I wrote some scripts that the whole server could be replaced automatically if some information like
									new server type, existing server name and new disk size are provided. Furthermore, the server will automatically back up every 4 hours, and the backup information will be stored in Google Cloud Storage
									with retenion 1 day. Please visit my article <a href="https://medium.com/@manbobo2012/host-a-minecraft-server-on-google-cloud-with-automatic-deployment-and-backup-f00d49a1a306?sk=ec7d5ca4c7d2c884d60e3068f1ad8097" style="background-color:#ffffa0">here</a>

								<p class=" pb-30">
									Over the past few years, we always talk about machine learning, AI and big data. 
									But is it really easy to implement it? The answer is yes and no. 
									For example, if we want to have an image recognition application, it will be very difficult to make if we start from scratch and study tens of thousands of algorithm. 
									However, there are many built-in API on cloud to let us do machine learning or AI. 
									This demo will implement a simple image recognition application on AWS within 15 mins.

								<p class=" pb-30">
									In recent years, we always talk about e-commerce. 
									For normal customer to customer (C to C) trading, what people need is to upload some sample photos to the e-commerce system which is very convenient. 
									However, there are too many products on the e-commerce platform. Thus, reliable keywords for searching are required. 
									If the product keyword is typed manually, there may be some mistakes and it turns out to have a lower clicking rate. 
									To solve this problem, we need an intelligent labeling. For this project, I will build a simplified e-commerce system. 
									The most important features are automatic labeling and detection. 
									When a product image is uploaded, the system will automatically label it and detect what it is. Both shopper keeper and consumer will definitely benefit from it. 
									For the selling side, it will reduce the error caused by humans. For the customer side, the searching result is guaranteed.
